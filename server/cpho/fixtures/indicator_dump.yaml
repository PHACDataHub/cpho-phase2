    impact_text: Chickenpox is a highly infectious disease that can cause fever and
      a blister-like rash. It can sometimes cause complications leading to hospitalization
      or even death. The virus can stay dormant in the body and re-emerge later in
      life as shingles. To prevent outbreaks, at least 95% of the population needs
      to be vaccinated. Since 2011, little progress has been made towards reaching
      national childhood vaccination goals, including for chickenpox. The COVID-19
      pandemic may have interrupted routine vaccinations, increasing the importance

      impacts, including impaired development, mental or emotional distress, and chronic
      diseases. The percentage of newborns with low birthweight has been increasing
      over the past decade. The reasons for this rise are unclear. It can only be
      partially explained by changing demographic factors, such as an increase in
      the number of people giving birth for the first time and people giving birth
      at older ages.

    impact_text: Polio is a highly infectious disease that affects the central nervous
      system. It can cause serious complications resulting in hospitalization, or
      even death. Thanks to vaccination programs, Canada was certified polio-free
      in 1994. However, travel-related cases are sometimes reported in Canada. To
      prevent outbreaks, at least 95% of the population needs to be vaccinated. Since
      2011, little progress has been made towards reaching national childhood vaccination
      goals, including for polio. The COVID-19 pandemic may have interrupted routine
      vaccinations, increasing the importance of promoting childhood vaccination.  This
      indicator aligns with the Canadian Indicator Framework for the Sustainable Development
      Goals (SDGs).

      with the 2021 reference year, CIS income data were produced from the Administrative
      Personal Income Masterfile, a comprehensive source of personal income data generated
      from T1 tax returns and associated tax slips. Estimates for previous reference
      years were produced using T1 tax returns only. Other changes to income processing
      were introduced at the same time. Estimates for 2021 also incorporated updates
      to the weighting methodology. These changes to the data source, processing system
      and weighting improve the quality of the data while having minimal impact on
      key CIS estimates and trends.<br />\r\nEstimates for Canada do not include the
      territories.<br />\r\nChildhood is defined as the stage of life from birth up
      until 18 years of age. People in this group are referred to as children and
      youth.<br />\r\nChildhood poverty rates are estimated using the 2018 based Market
      Basket Measure (MBM).<br />\r\nThe MBM is based on the cost of a specific basket
      of goods and services representing a modest, basic standard of living. It includes
      the costs of food, clothing, shelter, transportation and other items for a reference
      family. The disposable income of a family is compared to these costs to determine
      if it falls below the poverty line.<br />\r\nFor more information, please consult

      the data collection operations for the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS)
      2020. In 2020, data collection was stopped mid-March, towards the end of the
      first collection period, and did not resume until September. The second, third
      and fourth quarterly samples were collected during very short collection periods,
      each of about five weeks, from September to December. The impossibility of conducting
      in-person interviews, the shorter collection periods and collection capacity
      issues resulted in a significant decrease in the response rates. As for previous
      CCHS cycles, survey weights were adjusted to minimize any potential bias that
      could arise from survey non-response; non-response adjustments and calibration
      using available auxiliary information were applied and are reflected in the
      survey weights provided with the data file. Extensive validations of survey
      estimates were also performed and examined from a bias analysis perspective.
      Despite these rigorous adjustments and validations, the high non-response increases
      the risk of a remaining bias and the magnitude with which such a bias could

      CIS improved the methods and systems used to estimate income. Beginning with
      the 2021 reference year, CIS income data were produced from the Administrative
      Personal Income Masterfile, a comprehensive source of personal income data generated
      from T1 tax returns and associated tax slips. Estimates for previous reference
      years were produced using T1 tax returns only. Other changes to income processing
      were introduced at the same time. Estimates for 2021 also incorporated updates
      to the weighting methodology. These changes to the data source, processing system
      and weighting improve the quality of the data while having minimal impact on
      key CIS estimates and trends.<br />\r\nEstimates for Canada do not include the
      territories.<br />\r\nPoverty rates are estimated using the 2018 based Market
      Basket Measure (MBM).<br />\r\nThe MBM is based on the cost of a specific basket
      of goods and services representing a modest, basic standard of living. It includes
      the costs of food, clothing, shelter, transportation and other items for a reference
      family. The disposable income of a family is compared to these costs to determine
      if it falls below the poverty line.<br />\r\nFor more information, please consult

      caution (CV between 16% and 33.3%)<br />\r\nNo formal statistical tests were
      completed to make comparisons between sex or age groups.<br />\r\nSex or gender
      data were reported as per the original data source. Data that capture sex, gender,
      and other attributes, such as racialization and ethnicity, of all people in

      questions on cannabis in the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) (following
      the coming into force of the Cannabis Act in 2018).<br />\r\nThis indicator
      does not differentiate by reasons for cannabis use, such as medical versus non-medical
      purposes. In 2019, 36% of people (2.3 million) who used cannabis in the past
      year reported using it for medical purposes, unchanged from 2017 (37% or 1.6
      million). According to the Canadian Alcohol and Drugs Survey (2019) those who
      use cannabis for medical purposes are more likely to consume it on a daily or
      almost daily basis.<br />\r\nPercentages were calculated out of all respondents
      aged 15 years or older, excluding &ldquo;Don&#39;t know&rdquo;, &ldquo;Refuse&rdquo;,
      and &ldquo;Not stated&rdquo;.<br />\r\nSignificant differences (based on t-test
      and a threshold of p&lt;0.05): Since 2019, daily/almost daily use decreased
      significantly in those aged 20 to 29 years and increased significantly in those
      aged 60 years or older.<br />\r\nNon-overlapping 95% confidence intervals were
      used to infer statistically significant differences in data estimates between
      sex or age groups.<br />\r\nIf there was no overlap in 95% confidence intervals
      across age groups, the age group with the lowest or highest estimate was stated.<br
      />\r\nSex or gender data were reported as per the original data source. Data
      that capture sex, gender, and other attributes, such as racialization and ethnicity,

      Survey (CCHS) 2020. In 2020, data collection was stopped mid-March, towards
      the end of the first collection period, and did not resume until September.
      The second, third and fourth quarterly samples were collected during very short
      collection periods, each of about five weeks, from September to December. The
      impossibility of conducting in-person interviews, the shorter collection periods
      and collection capacity issues resulted in a significant decrease in the response
      rates. As for previous CCHS cycles, survey weights were adjusted to minimize
      any potential bias that could arise from survey non-response; non-response adjustments
      and calibration using available auxiliary information were applied and are reflected
      in the survey weights provided with the data file. Extensive validations of
      survey estimates were also performed and examined from a bias analysis perspective.
      Despite these rigorous adjustments and validations, the high non-response increases
      the risk of a remaining bias and the magnitude with which such a bias could
      impact estimates produced using the survey data.</p>"

      2020. In 2020, data collection was stopped mid-March, towards the end of the

      issues resulted in a significant decrease in the response rates. As for previous
      CCHS cycles, survey weights were adjusted to minimize any potential bias that
      could arise from survey non-response; non-response adjustments and calibration
      using available auxiliary information were applied and are reflected in the
      survey weights provided with the data file. Extensive validations of survey
      estimates were also performed and examined from a bias analysis perspective.
      Despite these rigorous adjustments and validations, the high non-response increases
      the risk of a remaining bias and the magnitude with which such a bias could

      mental health is an indicator of positive mental health, which is "a state of
      well-being that allows us to feel, think, and act in ways that enhance our ability
      to enjoy life and deal with the challenges we face ". It’s positively associated
      with other well-being outcomes. People are less likely to describe their mental
      health as very good or excellent if they are women, 2SLGBTQIA+, Indigenous,
      or have underlying health conditions. This could be for a variety of reasons,
      including stigma and discrimination.

      by differences in the age distribution of the population.<br />\r\nDeath is
      defined as the permanent disappearance of all evidence of life at any time after
      a live birth has taken place. Stillbirths are excluded.<br />\r\nDuring the
      production of each year&#39;s death statistics, data from previous years may

      excluded.<br />\r\nFor data years 2000 to 2009, missing data on sex of the deceased
      were imputed based on death registration number. Starting with the 2010 data
      year, missing data on sex of the deceased were imputed based on the cause of
      death information and a logistic regression.<br />\r\nThe &lsquo;all cancer
      mortality rate&rsquo; is calculated using the underlying cause of death. This
      is defined as:<br />\r\n- the disease or injury that initiated the train of
      events leading directly to death, or<br />\r\n- the circumstances of the accident
      or violence which produced the fatal injury<br />\r\nThe underlying cause is
      selected from the conditions listed on the medical certificate of cause of death.<br
      />\r\nCause of death is classified according to the World Health Organization
      (WHO), International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health
      Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). Cancer deaths include ICD-10 codes C00 to
      C97.<br />\r\nNo formal statistical tests were completed to make comparisons
      between sex groups.<br />\r\nSex or gender data were reported as per the original
      data source. Data that capture sex, gender, and other attributes, such as racialization

      Age standardization allows for comparisons of rates, over time and between provinces

      is updated annually with most recent data as well as updates to previous records,
      the incidence for any given diagnosis year may change from one release to the

      in undercounts of cases that are more pronounced in the most recently reported

      of data from a new reference year.<br />\r\nThe rules for multiple primaries
      developed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the

      allows for comparisons of rates, over time and between provinces and territories,

      change from one release to the next. Delays in the reporting of new cases to
      Statistics Canada typically result in undercounts of cases that are more pronounced
      in the most recently reported diagnosis year. Generally, the reporting delay

      diagnosis year with the reporting of data from a new reference year.<br />\r\nThe

      in-person interviews, the shorter collection periods and collection capacity
      issues resulted in a significant decrease in the response rates. As for previous
      CCHS cycles, survey weights were adjusted to minimize any potential bias that
      could arise from survey non-response; non-response adjustments and calibration
      using available auxiliary information were applied and are reflected in the
      survey weights provided with the data file. Extensive validations of survey
      estimates were also performed and examined from a bias analysis perspective.
      Despite these rigorous adjustments and validations, the high non-response increases
      the risk of a remaining bias and the magnitude with which such a bias could
      impact estimates produced using the survey data.</p>"

      affecting brain function. It is a chronic condition that usually gets worse
      over time. Dementia can occur in young people but is most common among people
      aged 65 years or older. The total number of people living with dementia in Canada
      has been increasing as a result of our growing and aging population. However,
      the rate of newly diagnosed dementia cases is decreasing, partly due to improvements
      in protective behaviours, such as healthy eating and keeping physically and
      mentally active. The rate of new cases of dementia is an important measure to
      help understanding the evolution of the condition in the Canadian population
      and to track progress on prevention.</p>

      may be driven by multiple factors, including (but not limited to) differences
      in health seeking behaviour and the availability and use of healthcare services,
      as well as true changes in health status. As such, CCDSS measures should be
      used cautiously to make inferences about population health during the COVID-19
      pandemic.<br />\r\nCrude rates are based on randomly rounded counts to an adjacent
      multiple of 5. They are reported for the overall population and by sex and age
      groups.<br />\r\nAge-standardized estimates are based on non-rounded counts
      and are age-standardized to the 2011 Canadian population using 5-year age groups.
      Age-standardized estimates are used for trend analysis from 2007 to 2019 and
      for geography for 2020. Age standardization adjusts for the differences in age
      structure between populations to allow better comparisons.<br />\r\nData are
      reported by fiscal year (April 1 to March 31). Only the first year of a fiscal
      year is shown in tables and figures. For example, fiscal year 2020&ndash;2021
      is referred to as 2020.<br />\r\nRates are not reported when the counts are
      less than 10 or the coefficient of variation of the rate is greater than 33.3%.<br
      />\r\nNunavut data are excluded before 2005&ndash;2006.<br />\r\nNewfoundland
      and Labrador data are excluded before 2008&ndash;2009.<br />\r\nYukon data are
      excluded before 2010&ndash;2011.<br />\r\nNorthwest Territories data are not
      available.<br />\r\nDue to periodic updates of the historical surveillance data,
      estimates for a particular disease and year may change over time, and may not
      be comparable to previous editions.<br />\r\nThese data were made possible through
      collaboration between PHAC and the 13 provincial and territorial governments.
      No endorsement by the provinces and territories is intended or should be inferred.
      Provincial and territorial data were contributed to the CCDSS as of April 2023.<br
      />\r\nNon-overlapping 95% confidence intervals were used to infer statistically
      significant differences in data estimates between sex or age groups.<br />\r\nSex
      or gender data were reported as per the original data source. Data that capture
      sex, gender, and other attributes, such as racialization and ethnicity, of all
      people in Canada are important as they can help inform the development and evaluation
      of inclusive programs and policies. Work is ongoing to fill these data gaps

      in Canada in 2021. While the COVID-19 pandemic impacted everyone in Canada,
      some communities have been more negatively affected than others. The rates of
      COVID-19 deaths were higher in neighbourhoods with lower income and higher ethnic
      and cultural diversity. Earlier in the pandemic, COVID-19 death rates were also
      high in long-term care facilities. COVID-19 vaccines and improved infection
      control practices helped to reduce the number of outbreaks and deaths in these
      settings.</p>

    impact_text: Tuberculosis is an infectious disease that primarily affects the
      lungs but can also affect other areas of the body. It’s preventable and can
      be cured with early diagnosis and treatment. Without treatment, tuberculosis
      can be serious and even fatal. Some communities are more affected than others.
      For example, tuberculosis rates in the Inuit are 135.1 per 100,000 population.
      In comparison, rates among the Canadian born non-Indigenous population are 0.3
      per 100,000 population. This difference is rooted in social and economic inequities.
      National monitoring is important for tracking progress.
